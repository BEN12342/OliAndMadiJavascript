console.log("Hello world!")

//To run Javascript on your computer, download node and run in the terminal "node <filename>".

//Javascript is usually ran on the browser, to help websites do things, such as move across the page, animation, APIs and more.

//Variables:

let a =1;
//Function scoped, can be redeclared
var b = 2;

//Can't ever change this value
const c = "Hello";

let d = True;

//If statements are mainly the same in python, however we add () around the condition and wrap {} around the code inside, eg:

if (b > a) {
  console.log("b is greater than a");
} else if (a == b) {
  console.log("a is b")
} else {
  console.log("a is greater than b");
}
//Same with while loops and for loops

//One cool thing we can do with for loops is:
let i;
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

//In python this is for i in range(100):.


//Arrays are the same, just use a keyword:

let arr = ["hello", "goodbye"];
